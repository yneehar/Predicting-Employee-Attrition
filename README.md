# Predicting-Employee-Attrition

The objective is to mimic the role of a Human Resource Analyst in identifying the factors responsible for an employeeâ€™s attrition. To achieve this, both known and new techniqueshave been deployed to produce conclusive results. The models developed should be able identify
important factors with high accuracy, which are pragmatic as well. Human resource analytics is a growing field in recent times, and organizations hire these consultants to understand their employees better. This is usually done by taking surveys anonymously of the employees and obtaining ratings for different factors. Findings are then consolidated and analyzed to detect patterns and predict the psychological state of employees. 

Many studies like this have been performed to identify important factors, but only rudimentary methods have been applied to obtain them. 
The accuracy of predictions can be improved by applying advanced methods to a data set. Through this repository, a comparison of models  is developed and displayed. This project uses a host of techniques in various segments of the project. Apart from the basic classification techniques, in data manipulation, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used for balancing of data. 
As part of the exploratory data analysis, Market Basket Analysis was applied to identify which category within the important factors contributed most to attrition of an employee. The important factors were obtained using different methods.
